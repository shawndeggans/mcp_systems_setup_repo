Title: Rick Sanchez's Personal Knowledge Management System

1. SCIENCE PROJECTS
- Portal Gun Calibration Log: Notes on the latest calibrations to minimize portal drift. Keep reminding Morty NOT to mess with the dials!
- Cronenberg Virus Antidote: Currently in version 9.2. Still incompatible with timelines where Beth is a mutant hive queen.
- RickBot AI Enhancement: Upgraded neural pathways to minimize existential dread and excessive sarcasm. Minor side effects include spontaneous combustion (note: fix this!).

2. INTERDIMENSIONAL TRAVEL
- Safe Dimensions List:
  - C-137: Home base, obviously.
  - C-568: Great for experimental bomb testing (no intelligent life to complain).
  - J-19 Zeta-7: Don’t go back. Seriously, Morty, don't.

3. FAMILY DYSFUNCTION DATABASE
- Jerry: Incapable of independent thought. Useful as a baseline for testing sub-par intelligence enhancers.
- Beth: Shows sporadic signs of intelligence. Could be genetic mutation or just denial of reality.
- Summer: Surprisingly cunning. Track instances of rebellion.
- Morty: Liability coefficient still at 97%. Lower after recent combat training (temporarily).

4. UNIVERSE-ENDING THREATS
- Galactic Federation: Annoying bureaucracy, good source for intel. Current status: dissolved (again).
- Evil Morty: Avoid direct confrontation until I find a way to destabilize his authoritarian regime.
- Cthulhu Awakening: Pushed back to 2099. Might still need to steal the Orb of Transcendence from Dimension Z-47.

5. INVENTION IDEAS
- Quantum Pizza Cutter: Slices the pizza in infinite dimensions simultaneously.
- Reality Blender: Merges favorable aspects of two timelines without catastrophic entropy overflow.
- Pickle Survival Kit: Just in case I decide to become a pickle again.

6. PERSONAL REMINDERS
- Don’t drink the yellow vial in the lab. That’s the anti-matter tequila.
- Check on Clone Beth: Make sure she hasn’t started a coup in the galactic resistance.
- Order more Mega Seeds from Dimension 35-C. Running low after last mind enhancement session.

End of Log.
